Once upon a time in Madison, Wisconsin, Bucky stumbled upon a wolverine. This 
wolverine thought he was a badass, which isn't suprising as they always have a
ridiculous egos even after embarrassing themselves publicly. Bucky decided 
that he'd had enough of the wolverine's nonsense, so he challenged the 
wolverine to a fight, to which the wolverine accepted. Word of the fight
quickly spread, and 80,000 people decided to get absolutely wasted at 11
o'clock in the morning to watch the ass-kicking that would ensue.

The roar of the 80,000 people could be heard from miles away in exciemnt for 
the game to start. People form all corners of the great state of wisconsin 
made the trek for this showdown. When the time came for kickoff every fan 
was one their feet going mental. It was not long for until the the badgers
Got their first touch down which ignatited the statdium.

Quarterback Jack Coan for the Wisconsin Badgers had an amazing game as well as
running back Johnathan Taylor. The Wolverine had no chance against the might of
the Badger and was getting thoroughly whooped on either side of the ball. The 
fans were roaring as they watched their team masacre the other!

Bucky finally wins this game which makes the fans crazy. After this games, the 
wolverine changed a lot. This wolverine does not show his ridiculous egos 
anymore. That was a fight that all people from state of Wisconsin remember.

When word spread about the wolverine's defeat, the story was quickly spun
to highlight the wolverine's incompotence rather than to celebrate Bucky's
great victory. While a great many will be quick to make fun of the wolverine,
those there to witniss the event will always remember the ferociousness that
Bucky showed that day. That being said, Michigan still sucks.
