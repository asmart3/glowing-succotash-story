Once upon a time in Madison, Wisconsin, Bucky stumbled upon a wolverine. This 
wolverine thought he was a badass, which isn't suprising as they always have a
ridiculous egos even after embarrassing themselves publicly. Bucky decided 
that he'd had enough of the wolverine's nonsense, so he challenged the 
wolverine to a fight, to which the wolverine accepted. Word of the fight
quickly spread, and 80,000 people decided to get absolutely wasted at 11
o'clock in the morning to watch the ass-kicking that would ensue.
